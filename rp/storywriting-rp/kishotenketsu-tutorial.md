# Kishōtenketsu for Beginners — An Introduction to Four Act Story Structure

1.
    1. Recently we presented a series of articles on three-act structure here on Mythic Scribes.
    2. This inspired me to try and write an article about a king of four act structure known as Kishōtenketsu.
    3. It's used in classical Chinese, Korean, and Japanese narratives, and is often mentioned as an example of a story structure without conflict.

2.
    1. Now, I'm not well versed in narrative theory.
    2. I find it interesting, but I'm far from an expert, and most of what I know of writing I have figured out myself (though the forums here on Mythic Scribes have been invaluable in doing just that).
    3. As such, this article will really only scratch the surface of Kishōtenketsu.

3.
    1. I'll begin by explaining the word itself and the basic principles behind the story structure.
    2. I'll then show two examples of stories told in this way, and finally I'll give a few tips I've found useful for wrapping my head around this whole concept.

4.
    1. That's not all though.
    2. Like I mentioned, this will be very basic, so I have included a list of links to further reading for those of you who are interested in digging a little deeper into this.

    1. Sounds good? Okay, here we go!

## 1. Kishōtenketsu

1.
    1. Let's start with the word itself.
    2. It's made up of the names of the four different acts of the structure:

        1. **Ki**: introduction
        2. **Shō**: development
        3. **Ten**: twist (complication)
        4. **Ketsu**: conclusion (reconciliation)

2.
    1. The first act is self-explanatory.
    2. It's where we're introduced to the story and we get to know the characters taking part and the world they live in.

3.
    1. Similarly, the second act doesn't require much explanation.
    2. This is where we get to know the characters a little better.
    3. We learn about their relation to each other and their place in the world.
    4. This is where we develop an emotional connection to the characters.

4.
    1. The third act however, the twist, is where things get a bit complicated.
    2. I've seen this act referred to as complication, and while I don't think that's technically correct, I feel it's a better name.
    3. Calling it a twist brings with it associations to plot-twists as we know them from more traditional western narratives.

5.
    1. This isn't necessarily the case here.
    2. It can be, but it doesn't have to.
    3. However, it's often something unexpected, and usually unrelated to what's happened in the first two acts.

6.
    1. Finally, the fourth act is about the impact of the third act on the first two acts.
    2. This is why I like the term reconciliation.
    3. The third act will affect the situation presented in the first and second act, and in the fourth act the state of the world in first and second act is reconciled with the events of the third.
