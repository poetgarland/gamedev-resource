# Yonkoma

1.
    1. ***Yonkoma* manga** (４コマ漫画, "four cell manga" or **4-*koma*** for short), a comic strip format, generally consists of gag comic strips within four panels of equal size ordered from top to bottom.
    2. They also sometimes run right-to-left horizontally or use a hybrid 2×2 style, depending on the layout requirements of the publication in which they appear.
    3. Although the word *yonkoma* comes from Japanese, the style also exists outside Japan in other Asian countries as well as in the English-speaking market (particularly in mid-20th century United States strips, where *Peanuts* popularized the format; most strips there, including the last several years of *Peanuts*, have since moved to a three-panel format).
