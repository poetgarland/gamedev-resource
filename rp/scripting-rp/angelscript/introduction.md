# Introduction

1.
    1. The AngelCode Scripting Library, or AngelScript as it is also known, is an extremely flexible cross-platform scripting library designed to allow applications to extend their functionality through external scripts.
    2. It has been designed from the beginning to an easy to use component, both for the application programmer and the script writer.

2.
    1. Efforts have been to let it call standard C functions and C++ methods with little to no need for proxy functions.
    2. The application smply registers the functions, objects, and methods that the scripts should be able to work with and nothing more has to be done with your code.
    3. The same functions used by the application internally can also be used by the scripting engine, which eliminates the need to duplicate functionality.

3.
    1. For the script writer the scripting language follows the widely known syntax of C++/C, but without the need to worry about pointers and memory leaks.
    2. Contrary to most scripting languages, AngelScript uses the common C/C++ datatypes for more efficient communication with the host application.

4.
    1. AngelScript is completely free, released under the zlib license.
    2. I only ask for your recognition, nothing else.
    3. However, if you would like to make a donation I would be very grateful.
    4. Your donation gives me more inspiration and will allow me to spend more time working with AngelScript.

    1. Give the library a try, and let me know how you like it.
