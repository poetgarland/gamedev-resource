# Platform Invoke (P/Invoke)

1.
    1. P/Invoke is a technology that allows you to access structs, callbacks, and functions in unmanaged libraries from your managed code.
    2. Most of the P/Invoke API is contained in two namespaces: `System` and `System.Runtime.InteropServices`.
    3. Using these two namespaces give you the tools to describe how you want to communicate with the native component.

2.
    1. Let's start from the most common example, and that is calling unmanaged functions in your managed code.
    2. Let's show a message box from a command-line application:

```cs
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class Program
{
    // Import user32.dll (containing the function we need) and define
    // the method corresponding to the native function
    [DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet = CharSet.Unicode, SetLastError = true)]
    private static extern int MessageBox(IntPtr hWnd, string lpText, string lpCaption, uint uType);

    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Invoke the function as a regular managed method
        MessageBox(IntPtr.Zero, "Command-line message box", "Attention!", 0);
    }
}
```

3.
    1. The previous example is simple, but it does show off what's needed to invoke unmanaged functions from managed code.
    2. Let's step through the example:

        1. Line #2 shows the using statement for the `System.Runtime.InteropServices` namespace that holds all the items needed.
        2. Line #8 introduces the `DllImport` attribute. This attribute is crucial, as it tells the runtime that it should load the unmanaged DLL. The string passed in is the DLL our target function is in. Additionally, it specifies which character set to use for marshalling the strings. Finally, it specifies that this function calls SetLastError and that the runtime should capture that error code so the user can retrieve it via `Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()`.
        3. Line #9 is the crux of the P/Invoke work. It defines a managed method that has the **exact same signature** as the unmanaged one. The declaration has a new keyword that when you invoke it, the runtime should find it in the DLL specified in `DllImport` attribute.

4.
    1. The rest of the example is just invoking the method as you would any other managed method.

5.
    1. The sample is similar for macOS.
    2. The name of the library in the `DllImport` attribute needs to change since macOS has a different scheme of naming dynamic libraries.
    3. The following sample uses the `getpid(2)` function to get the process ID of the application and print it out to the console:

```cs
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace PInvokeSamples
{
    public static class Program
    {
        // Import the libSystem shared library and define the method
        // corresponding to the native function
        [DllImport("libSystem.dylib")]
        private static extern int getpid();

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Invoke the function and get the process ID.
            int pid = getpid();
            Console.WriteLine(pid);
        }
    }
}
```

6.
    1. It is also similar on Linux.
    2. The function name is the same, since `getpid(2)` is a standard POSIX system call.

```cs
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

namespace PInvokeSamples
{
    public static class Program
    {
        // Import the libc shared library and define the method
        // corresponding to the native function.
        [DllImport("libc.so.6")]
        private static extern int getpid();

        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Invoke the function and get the process ID.
            int pid = getpid();
            Console.WriteLine(pid);
        }
    }
}
```
